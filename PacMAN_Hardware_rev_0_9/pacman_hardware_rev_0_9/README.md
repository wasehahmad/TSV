# LFEV Pack Manager Main Board



## Overview


This directory contains the design of the LFEV "Packman" board. 
The "Packman" board, or
Pack Manager Board is responsible for 
monitoring the cells in the LFEV battery pack. This 
system contains
 a small AVR microprocessor capable of communicating high level 
data to the
SCADA system, while monitoring the pack for faults, 
managing cell charge/discharge, and tracking
the pack state of 
charge. This directory contains the PCB schematic and board 
layout
of the system.
